<p>
I am a fourth year undergraduate in the CS integrated master's program. 

Most of my experience in ML is from coursework (NLP, Speech/Audio Processing) and 
reading literature on neurosymbolic AI as part of UT's Directed Reading Program. 
The research experience I do have is in bioinformatics and data analytics. I also have some
experience with iOS development. 

<p>
Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

<p>
(1) Neurosymbolic Learning

<p>
(2) Using LLMs as evolutionary operators

<p>
(3) Foundational video models

<p>

and I am open to other topics as well.

I have teamed up with Sicong Che.
